Hey brother,

We're starting a new IGNITION group on the 1st. Here's what we're going to do so you know what to expect and can say “I'm in” if it sparks something in you.

This isn't a course. It's not motivation. It's a firestarter.

For 6 weeks, we're going to build **momentum** from the ground up by confronting the stuff that's been keeping you passive, distracted, or stuck. Not by adding more information, but by adding pressure, structure, and brotherhood.

Each week, you'll get:

* A live call where we dig into the real stuff like where _drive_ comes from, why it _dies_, and _how to restart it_
* An exercise that actually gets under your skin and into your life
* A journal prompt to reflect on what moved, what cracked, and what still resists
* A partner call to speak it out loud, sharpen it, and carry it forward

You won't just think differently, you'll move differently.

By the end, you'll have chosen a **goal that matters**, and you'll be in motion toward it with clarity, fuel, and accountability.

## How the IGNITE Workshop Works

This isn't some "rah-rah" motivational seminar. It's a step-by-step system that works in real life, for real men with real responsibilities.

### **Here's what you'll get:**

* **Weekly Focus:** Each week, we'll tackle one part of the 3F Framework, breaking it down into clear, actionable steps.
* **Real-World Application:** No theories. You'll apply what you learn immediately, with support every step of the way.
* **Community & Coaching:** You're not doing this alone. You'll join a group of like-minded men and expert coaches all pushing for the same thing: results.

All you need is a commitment to yourself—and about **2 hours a week**.

## What's the Investment?

* **$100 per week**
* **6 weeks total = $600 USD**
* Flexible: Pay weekly or upfront.

**Think about it:**

* How much is your time worth?
* How much energy do you waste spinning your wheels?
* What's the cost of another year stuck in the same cycle?

## Our Guarantee: No Risk, All Reward

Investing in yourself can feel risky.**That's why we offer a 100% Money-Back Guarantee.**

If you're done with the overwhelm…

If you're ready to live with clarity, purpose, and focus…

If you're ready to finally take control of your time and energy…

**Just reply with “I'M IN.”**

We'll get you everything you need to start your journey with the IGNITE Workshop.

Let's do this.

There's a version of you that knows how to lead. One that creates with sharp precision. One that aligns. One that adapts. One that speaks.

IGNITION doesn't _give_ you those - It lights the heat that **unlocks them**.

Ready to light the fire?

Just reply with _"I'm in!"_
